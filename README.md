# Image compress and resize

To compress an image using the `image-compress.py` script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 image-compress.py /path/to/input/directory /path/to/output/directory width height
```

For example, to compress all images in the directory /from/ and save the compressed images in the directory /to/ with a size of 2000x2000, you would use the following command:

```bash
python3 image-compress.py /from/ /to/ 2000 2000
```
